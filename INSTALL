Installation instructions for dae, the digital audio editor
First install ecasound and python.
You should have packages for these in your distribution.
Extract the tar.bz2 file.
A directory dae will be created.
Change into that directory and run:
./install.sh
Ecasound and python must be installed before dae will install.
./install.sh --help can be run to show installer options.
Note that python versions 2.6 and later currently gives errors when dae is
entered or exited, but the program still functions correctly.
Once dae is installed, see the man page for a way to get rid of these
errors.
